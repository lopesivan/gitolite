Just to report, I did have a similar problem. But in my case i just follow those steps:

Follow these steps to create a $HOME/.Xauthority file.

Log in as user and confirm that you are in the user's home directory.

# Rename the existing .Xauthority file by running the following command
mv .Xauthority old.Xauthority

# xauth with complain unless ~/.Xauthority exists
touch ~/.Xauthority

# only this one key is needed for X11 over SSH
xauth generate :0 . trusted

# generate our own key, xauth requires 128 bit hex encoding
xauth add ${HOST}:0 . $(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)

# To view a listing of the .Xauthority file, enter the following
xauth list
After that no more problems with .Xautority file since then.
